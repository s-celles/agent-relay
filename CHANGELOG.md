## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Neutral request/event model (`internal/core`): `InferRequest`, `Event`,
  `EventSink`, and the `Backend` interface with a self-registering backend
  factory registry.
- Claude backend adapter (`internal/backend/claude`): supervised `claude` CLI
  subprocess per request, prompt piped via stdin, defensive `stream-json`
  parsing, environment sanitization (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`,
  `CLAUDECODE`, plus operator deny list), and process-group kill on
  cancellation or timeout.
- Anthropic Messages API endpoint (`POST /v1/messages`) with SSE streaming
  and non-streaming responses.
- OpenAI Chat Completions API endpoint (`POST /v1/chat/completions`) with
  SSE streaming and non-streaming responses.
- Bearer / `x-api-key` authentication with constant-time token comparison;
  unauthenticated requests are rejected before any subprocess is spawned.
- Non-blocking concurrency limiter: a full pool answers 503 immediately.
- Per-request timeout enforcement via context.
- Env-first configuration with fail-fast startup guards: non-loopback binds
  refuse to start without auth tokens; agentic mode on a non-loopback bind
  refuses to start without per-request authorization.
- Agentic execution mode scaffold, disabled by default and loudly logged
  when enabled.
- Unauthenticated `GET /health`; authenticated `GET /v1/metrics` (minimal
  JSON counters).
- Request-ID middleware and structured JSON logging (`log/slog`).
- Test suite: wire-translation tables, limiter/dispatcher lifecycle with a
  fake backend, config-guard truth table, and Claude adapter tests driven by
  a stub CLI script (no tokens spent).
- Dockerfile (multi-stage, bundles the `claude` CLI) and docker-compose
  example; deployment documentation.
