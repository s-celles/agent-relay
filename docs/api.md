# HTTP API

## Authentication

Every endpoint except `GET /health` requires a configured token, supplied as
either header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
x-api-key: <token>
```

Tokens are compared in constant time. Unauthenticated requests are rejected
with 401 **before** any backend subprocess is spawned. When no tokens are
configured (only permitted on loopback binds), all callers pass.

## `POST /v1/messages` — Anthropic Messages

Request body (v1 supports text content only):

```json
{
  "model": "sonnet",
  "max_tokens": 1024,
  "system": "optional system prompt (string or text blocks)",
  "stream": true,
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "hello"}
  ]
}
```

- `content` may be a string or an array of content blocks. Supported block
  types: `text`, `tool_use` (assistant turns), `tool_result` (user turns),
  and base64 `image`/`document` blocks (see "Attachments" below).
  `thinking` blocks echoed back by clients are dropped silently; unknown
  block types are rejected with 400.
- Roles are limited to `user` and `assistant`.
- `max_tokens` is accepted for wire compatibility (the Anthropic format makes
  it mandatory) but **not enforced** by the claude backend — the CLI has no
  flag to cap output tokens, so responses may exceed it. The relay logs a
  one-time warning when a request carries `max_tokens` on a backend that
  cannot enforce it.
- `tools` and `tool_choice` are decoded, but serving them requires a backend
  that supports client-defined tools — see "Client-defined tools" below.
- `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, and `stop_sequences` are decoded but
  **ignored** by the claude backend (the CLI has no such flags). The relay
  logs a one-time warning naming the parameters it dropped, rather than
  ignoring them silently.

**Streaming** (`"stream": true`) returns `text/event-stream` with the
standard Anthropic event sequence, flushed per event: `message_start`,
`content_block_start`, `content_block_delta` (text deltas),
`content_block_stop`, `message_delta` (stop reason + usage), `message_stop`.
Backend failures mid-stream are delivered as an `error` event.

**Non-streaming** returns a single `message` object with text content blocks
and token usage. When a backend emits tool calls, responses carry `tool_use`
blocks (`content_block_start` + `input_json_delta` when streaming) and
`stop_reason: "tool_use"`.

### Attachments (images and PDFs)

Standard base64 `image` and `document` blocks are accepted — the same shape
Anthropic SDK clients already send:

```json
{"type": "image", "source": {"type": "base64", "media_type": "image/png", "data": "<base64>"}}
{"type": "document", "source": {"type": "base64", "media_type": "application/pdf", "data": "<base64>"}}
```

Accepted media types: `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`,
`application/pdf`; 20 MiB decoded per block; only `base64` sources (no URL
fetching). On the claude backend this works as a **bridge**: the relay
decodes each attachment into a per-request ephemeral directory, runs the CLI
with that directory as its working directory, and replaces the block with a
text reference that the CLI's read-only Read tool follows to view the file.
The directory is deleted when the request ends.

Two consequences of the bridge design: viewing is *model-mediated* (the model
follows the reference; in practice it does, but it is not the structural
guarantee of native API vision), and a request carrying attachments runs in a
clean ephemeral directory — it does not see the relay's own working
directory.

### Client-defined tools

The wire format fully supports structured content: `tool_use`/`tool_result`
blocks in conversation *history* are accepted on any backend (the claude
backend flattens them into its text transcript). However, a request carrying
`tools[]` — asking the model to call the *caller's* tools and stop — is
rejected with 400 unless the backend reports client-tool support.

The claude CLI backend does **not**: the CLI runs its own agent loop with its
own tools and has no raw tool-calling mode. In practice this means agentic
clients (the Claude Agent SDK, Claude Code) still cannot use the relay as
their backend; classic chat clients are unaffected. For the full comparison
of what the API offers that the relay cannot, see
[API vs relay limitations](limitations.md).

## `POST /v1/chat/completions` — OpenAI Chat Completions

```json
{
  "model": "sonnet",
  "stream": false,
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "optional"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "hello"}
  ]
}
```

`system` / `developer` messages map onto the backend system prompt.
`max_tokens` and `max_completion_tokens` (the modern OpenAI parameter, which
takes precedence) are optional here and carry the same limitation as on
`/v1/messages`: accepted, but not enforced by the claude backend. Sampling
parameters (`temperature`, `top_p`, `stop`) are likewise decoded but ignored,
with a one-time warning.

Streaming returns `chat.completion.chunk` SSE frames terminated by
`data: [DONE]`. With `stream_options: {"include_usage": true}`, a final chunk
with an empty `choices` array carries `usage` just before `[DONE]`, as the
OpenAI API does. Non-streaming returns a `chat.completion` object with
`usage`.

## Agentic requests

When the relay runs with `RELAY_AGENTIC_ENABLED=true` and
`RELAY_AGENTIC_PER_REQUEST_AUTHZ=true`, agentic execution is granted **per
request**: in addition to the normal caller credential, the request must
carry a valid agentic credential from `RELAY_AGENTIC_TOKENS`:

```
X-Agentic-Authorization: Bearer <agentic-token>
```

- Without the header, the request is served in plain inference mode (no
  permission flags, no side effects).
- With an invalid credential — including a caller token, the two sets are
  never interchangeable — the request is rejected with **403** before any
  subprocess is spawned.
- If the header is sent to a relay whose agentic mode is disabled, the
  response is also 403.

Authorized agentic requests run with the operator-configured permission
flags, each in its own ephemeral working directory. See
[execution-modes.md](execution-modes.md) for the full inference-vs-agentic
comparison.

### Retrieving agentic outputs

By default an agentic request's working directory is deleted when the
request ends. Send `X-Agentic-Keep-Outputs: true` on an agentic-authorized
request to retain it: the response carries an unguessable id in the
`X-Agentic-Outputs` header, usable with:

| Method + path | Effect |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/outputs/{id}` | JSON listing (`{"id", "files":[{"path","size"}]}`) |
| `GET /v1/outputs/{id}/files/{path}` | Download one artifact (octet-stream) |
| `DELETE /v1/outputs/{id}` | Release immediately (204) |

All three require the normal caller credential. Retained outputs are swept
after `RELAY_OUTPUTS_TTL` (default 10m); the header on a non-agentic request
is a 400. Path traversal in `{path}` is refused.

## `GET /health`

Unauthenticated liveness probe: `{"status":"ok"}`.

## `GET /v1/metrics`

Authenticated, minimal JSON counters:

```json
{
  "uptime_seconds": 120,
  "requests_total": 42,
  "in_flight": 1,
  "rejected_busy": 0,
  "unauthorized": 3,
  "backend_errors": 0
}
```

## Errors

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 400 | Malformed body, unsupported role or content block type. |
| 401 | Missing or invalid credential. |
| 502 | Backend failed before producing a stream. |
| 503 | All concurrency slots busy; retry later. No subprocess was spawned. |

Error bodies follow the wire format of the endpoint (Anthropic
`{"type":"error","error":{...}}` shape on `/v1/messages`, OpenAI
`{"error":{...}}` shape on `/v1/chat/completions`).

Every response carries an `X-Request-Id` header for log correlation.
